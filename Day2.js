// Activity 1: Arthmatic Operations
// Task1: write a program to add two number and log the result to the console.

let num1 = 20;
let num2 = 10;
result = num1 + num2;
console.log(result);

// Task 2: Write a program to subtract two numbers and log the result to the console.

result = num1 - num2;
console.log(result);

// Task 3: Write a program to multiply two numbers and log the result to the console.

result = num1 * num2;
console.log(result);

// Task 4: Write a program to divide two numbers and log the result to the console.

result = num1 / num2;
console.log(result);


// Task 5: Write a program to find the remainder when one number is divided by another and log the result to the console.

result = num1 % num2;
console.log(result);


// Activity 2: Assignment Operators
// Task 6: Use the += operator to add a number to a variable and log the result to the console.

let num = 25;
num += 25;
console.log(num);

// Task 7: Use the -= operator to subtract a number from a variable and log the result to the console.
num -= 25;

// Activity 3: Comparison Operators
// Task 8: Write a program to compare two numbers using > and < and log the result to the console.

console.log(num1 > num2);
console.log(num1 < num2);

// Task 9: Write a program to compare two numbers using >= and <= and log the result to the console.
console.log(num1 >= num2);
console.log(num1 <= num2);

// Task 10: Write a program to compare two numbers using == and === and log the result to the console.
console.log(num1 == num2);
console.log(num1 === num2);

// Activity 4: Logical Operators
// Task 11: Write a program that uses the && operator to combine two conditions and log the result to the console.

console.log(num1 > 10 && num2 < 20);


// Task 12: Write a program that uses the || operator to combine two conditions and log the result to the console.

console.log(num1 <= 10 || num2 >= 10);


// Task 13: Write a program that uses the ! operator to negate a condition and log the result to the console.

console.log(num1 != num2)


// Activity 5: Ternary Operator
// Task 14: Write a program that uses the ternary operator to check if a number is positive or negative and log the result to the console.

num1 > 0 ? console.log('Positive') : console.log('Negitive');
